== whatami

This is a small example for using angularjs. Does this application does something useful anyway?

Yes. Whatami allows you to track each day where you wake up. You can visualize your collected data.

You can see a running demo here http://www.m-krausse.de/whatami

I am always open for any suggestions, feature requests and bug reports.
